<p><strong>XML:</strong>XML is a programming language and a platform.
</p>
<br>
<p>In computing, Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable through use of tags that can be created and defined by users. Much like natural language is extensible (that is, can grow) when speakers create new words and agree on what they mean, XML is a markup language that can grow when users create new elements and agree on what they mean. This makes XML able to capture intent in a way much broader than a nonextensible markup language such as HTML. For example, XML can mark up machine-readably that apples and bananas are types of fruit, which is semantically deeper than the purpose of HTML.[2] However, HTML is useful for display of content; often HTML is used to display XML content after transformation with XSL.[3]

The W3C's XML 1.0 Specification[4] and several other related specifications[5]—all of them free open standards—define XML.[6]

The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet.[7] It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures[8] such as those used in web services.

Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages, while programmers have developed many application programming interfaces (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data.</p>
