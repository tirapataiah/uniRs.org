<p>Welcome to Apache Maven
Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

If you think that Maven could help your project, you can find out more information about in the "About Maven" section of the navigation. This includes an in-depth description of what Maven is, a list of some of its main features, and a set of frequently asked questions about what Maven is.

This site is separated into the following sections, depending on how you'd like to use Maven:

Use	Download, Install, Run Maven	Configure, Use Maven and Maven Plugins
Information for those needing to build a project that uses Maven	Information for those wanting to use Maven to build their project, including a "10 minute test" that gives a practical overview of Maven's main features in just 10 minutes and plugin list for more information on each plugin
Extend	Write Maven Plugins	Improve the Maven Central Repository
Information for those who want to provide a Maven plugin for shared functionality or to accompany their own product or toolset	Information for those who may or may not use Maven, but are interested in getting project metadata into the central repository
Contribute	Help Maven	Develop Maven
Information if you'd like to get involved: Maven is an open source community and welcomes contributions.	Information for those who are currently developers, or who are interested in contributing to the Maven project itself
Each guide is divided into a number of trails to get you started on a particular topic, and includes a reference area and a "cookbook" of common examples.

You can access the guides at any time from the left navigation. If you are looking for a quick reference, you can use the documentation index.

How to Get Support
Support for Maven is available in a variety of different forms.

To get started, search the documentation, issue tracker, the wiki or the mailing list archives to see if the problem has been solved or reported before.

If the problem has not been reported before, the recommended way to get help is to subscribe to the Maven Users Mailing list. Many other users and Maven developers will answer your questions there, and the answer will be archived for others in the future.

You can also reach the Maven developers on IRC.

Maven is a part of the Apache Software Foundation. We'd like to thank the sponsors that provide financial assistance to the foundation. For more information on how you can support the foundation, see the sponsorship page.
